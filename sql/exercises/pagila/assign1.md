### SQL queries on the Pagila DB

#### Submission: 16 February (before midnight)

Answer the following questions by writing SQL queries on the Pagila DB. You should have 1 SQL `select` statement for
each question. Create a file named `assign1_1234567.sql` (replace `1234567` by your student number), and write your
answers in that file. Make sure you label your answers correctly with a proper comment (such as `-- 1.`) before each
query. Write a comment at the top of that file containing your name and your student number. That `.sql` file is the
only file you will have to submit on LÃ©a for this assignment.

When not specified, include only the columns that make sense in the results. Otherwise, include only the columns
specified in the questions. Rename the columns appropriately when necessary to improve the readability of the results.
For example, when using the `count` aggregate function, rename the column to avoid having only `count` as the column
name.
