-- 6.	Find the academic number of academics who have an interest in databases (you should look for the word “database” in both the Interest and Field tables).
SELECT DISTINCT acnum
FROM interest

WHERE title LIKE '%database%'
   OR descrip LIKE '%database%';

-- 7.	Find how many academics are interested in the field number 292.
