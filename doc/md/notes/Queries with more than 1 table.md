# Queries with more than 1 table

## Contacts DB

```postgresql
SET search_path TO contacts;
```

1. *Cartesian product*: match every of a table with every row of the other table
    - gives too many rows
    - rarely used because it doesn't usually give useful information
    - and it can become very inefficient if the tables involved are large
        - the number of rows in the results will be the multiplication of the number of rows in each table involved

```postgresql
SELECT *
FROM call,
     contact;
```

2. *Join*: keep only the matching rows, by "following" the foreign key from `call` to `contact`
    - this is the old way to do a join (a cartesian product followed by a `WHERE` condition)

```postgresql
SELECT *
FROM call,
     contact
WHERE call.contact_id = contact.contact_id;
```

### Joins

#### Inner Join

3. A more modern way to express a join in SQL
    - there are many types of joins, the most common kind is an `INNER JOIN`

```postgresql
SELECT *
FROM call
         INNER JOIN contact
                    ON call.contact_id = contact.contact_id;
```

#### Natural join

4. Join on columns with the same names, using the = operator, and by removing duplicate columns
    - note that the columns are in a different order
    - it's not recommended (even discouraged) to use natural joins because the join condition is not specified and might
      have consequences difficult to predict, especially on the long term if the database is modified after the queries
      have been written

```postgresql
SELECT *
FROM call
         NATURAL JOIN contact;

```

- The phone call with ID 2 doesn't match any contact, therefore it is not listed in the results
- Whenever we use = with `NULL`, it's always false, hence call 3 is not in the results

#### Outer Joins

5. Use a *left outer join* to keep the phone calls not matching any contact
    - it is like an inner join, but rows on the left not matching anything on the right will be kept
    - use a *right outer join* to keep the contacts not matching any phone call
    - or a *full outer join* to keep rows not matching on both sides

```postgresql
SELECT *
FROM call
         LEFT OUTER JOIN contact
                         ON call.contact_id = contact.contact_id;
```

```postgresql
SELECT *
FROM call
         RIGHT OUTER JOIN contact
                         ON call.contact_id = contact.contact_id;
```

```postgresql
SELECT *
FROM call FULL OUTER JOIN contact
    ON call.contact_id = contact.contact_id;
```
