# ER to Relational

## Converting an ER Diagram to a Relational Schema

### Relational Schema

- **Relational schema (relational data model)**: set of table schemas
- **Table schema**:
    - *basic form*: table name and set of column names
        - `employee(emp_id, name, address, dept_id)`


- **Table schema**:
    - *detailed form*: table name and set of column names plus data types and primary keys, and sometimes other
      constraints such as `NOT NULL`
        - columns part of the primary key are either underlined or capitalized
            - to avoid issues with some DBMS, write table and column names with lowercase characters only in
              the `CREATE TABLE` statements
        - columns part of a foreign key are followed by a *
        - *example*: `employee(EMP_ID integer, name text, address text, dept_id* integer)`
    - other forms in between the previous 2 are also possible

### Steps

1. Every entity in the ER diagram will be a table in the relational schema
    - all attributes of the entity become columns in the table schema
    - primary key attributes become primary key columns in the table schema


2. Every many-many relationship will be a table
    - attributes of the relationship are added to the table schema
    - add a foreign key column (or columns) for each table involved in the relationship
    - choose a primary key from the current columns, or add a new primary key columns (such as an ID column)

**Advice**: count the number of entities in the ER diagram, add the number of many-many relationships to it, and this
number will be the number of tables in the relational schema

3. Many-one relationships will **NOT** become tables
    - instead, add a foreign key column on the many side referencing the primary on the one side
    - if the one side is actually *exactly one*, then make the foreign key column `NOT NULL`

4. One-one relationships will **NOT** become tables
    - treat the one-one relationaships similarly to many-one relationships, except that you bring only one of the
      primary keys as a foreign key on the other side
    - there's no perfect rule about which side to choose, it depends on the context
    - if it is an exactly-one-at-most-one relationship, then usually the foreign key will be on the at-most-one side (
      pointing to the exactly-one side)
